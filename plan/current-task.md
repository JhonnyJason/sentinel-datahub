# Task 1
Implement Data Retrieval EOD

## Details
Everything depends on the data retrieval - so we implement this first.
The MarketStack API seems the best way to go as they are affordable and their API is of good quality. Some generated API code is available in ./sources/source/marketstackmodule/marketstack-api/ from there we should extract the exact pieces which we need and implement a first straight data-retrieval use-case.

## Sub-Tasks
- [x] Summarize the marketstack API
- [x] Implement a convenience Wrapper in the marketstackmodule
- [ ] Implement top-level control function in the datamodule
- [ ] Test and fix
